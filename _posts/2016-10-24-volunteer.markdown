All Hack Oregon projects are open source and built by an interdisciplinary team of volunteers.  We strive to have a mixed teams of varying levels of experience to work together to solve civic data problems and build skills, which you can get training for through Hack University courses.

### What to Expect

Weekly contribution time is estimated anywhere from 3 and 10 hours a week, which includes weekly in-person build sessions (fueled by pizza)

Our Fall/Winter project season will run from October 2016 - March 2017
1. Pre-production phase: October - December:
  * Training through Hack University courses
  * An A-Team of experienced volunteers will begin project work and preparation, ramping up to the production phase
2. Production phase: January - March:
  * A-Team will be joined by volunteers that have completed training
  * Project teams will work together to complete projects by the Demo Day deadline
  * Closer to the deadline, weâ€™ll have a Buildathon hackday to work toward project completion with the help of community volunteers outside of the project teams
