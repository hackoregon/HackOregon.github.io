We offer specialized, project based classes at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels teaching skills and technologies we use in our project season that help get you job-ready as well prepare you to contribute to data-driven Hack Oregon projects, providing you with real-world experience and portfolio work if you choose to do so.


During the Fall/Winter 2016 - 2017 season, many courses will have class deliverables that directly contribute and help progress the Hack Oregon volunteer projects.
